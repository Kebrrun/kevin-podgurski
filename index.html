    <h2>Passionate Gamer - Apprentice in Programming</h2>
    <p>
        Besides gaming and streaming, I've been really into coding for the past few months and have looked at front-end related stuff, Python, HTML and CSS. My main focus lately has been on HTML and CSS to further expand my coding knowledge, which resulted into making this tiny info site about myself.
